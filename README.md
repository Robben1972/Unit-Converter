# Unit Converter API

This is a Unit Converter API built using FastAPI. It allows users to convert between different units efficiently.

## Task Description
This project is part of the [Roadmap.sh Backend Developer Projects](https://roadmap.sh/projects/unit-converter). The goal is to create a simple unit converter API that supports multiple units of measurement, providing accurate conversions through an HTTP-based interface.

## Features
- Convert between various units (e.g., length, weight, temperature, etc.).
- Simple API endpoints for unit conversion.
- Fast and lightweight, built with FastAPI.

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed (recommended version: 3.8+). Install the required dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Project
To start the API server, simply run:

```sh
python3 main.py
```

This will start the server on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Usage
Once the server is running, you can test the API using a browser, Postman, or `curl`.
